    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (8oz/225g) butter ( melted and cooled to room temperature)
        </li>
        <li>1 and 1/4 cup (7 1/2 oz/213g) dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (6oz/170g) white sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 and 1/2 cups (12 1/2oz/355g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 generous tablespoon dark chocolate (rough chopped)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl add in the melted butter, both sugars, eggs, and 
            vanilla extract and whisk together until combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir with a spatula to form 
            your cookie dough. IMPORTANT STEP: Now, chill the dough for a 
            minimum of 2 hours before scooping to avoid the cookies from 
            spreading while baking.</li>
        <li>Using a 1/4 cup measure, scoop the cookie dough base into roughly 
            14 cookies (weighing roughly 2 1/2 oz each)</li>
        <li>Press your chocolate chunks into your base cookie and fold the 
            cookie dough over itself to make sure the chocolate chunks are 
            distributed throughout</li>
        <li>Bake cookies in oven at 350 for 12 minutes</li>
    </ol>
